## Handwritten-digits-recognition
This Flask project enables the recognition of handwritten digits. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) principle, comprising two main components:

### Components:

#### Models (Handwritten Digit Recognition):
Built a deep learning model trained on MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, achieving an accuracy rate of 94.5%.

#### View (Interactive Interface):
Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.

#### Controllers:
The connection between the view and model is established through a Python web service built on the Flask framework.

## Usage

2. Install the necessary dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `app.py`.
4. Access the application through a web browser [http://127.0.0.1:5000].
